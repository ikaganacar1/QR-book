# QR Book of My Sister

I created a book filled with QR codes using this code. It was a unique and unusual gift for my sister. The book contains roughly 300 pages, with each page featuring 15 QR codes. The QR codes lead to a variety of content, including:<br/>

    *Images
    *Song links
    *YouTube videos
    *Memes
    *Random stock photos
    * Funny and random links
<br/>
The most exciting part is that there’s a hidden riddle in the book. My sister must solve the riddle to claim a 10,000 Turkish Lira (TL) gift. However, there’s a catch: 27.4 TL is deducted every day, and the gift will reduce to 0 TL by March 30, 2025 (exactly one year from her birthday).
