# QR Book of My Sister

I created a book filled with **QR codes** using this code. It was a unique and unusual gift for my sister. The book contains roughly **300 pages**, with each page featuring **15 QR codes**. The QR codes lead to a variety of content, including:<br/>

* Images
* Song links
* YouTube videos
* Memes
* Random stock photos
* Funny and random links
    
The most exciting part is that there’s a hidden puzzle in the book. My sister must solve the riddle to claim a **10,000 Turkish Lira (TL)** gift. However, there’s a catch: 27.4 TL is deducted every day, and the gift will reduce to 0 TL by March 30, 2025 (exactly one year from her birthday). I also made her a [WEBPAGE](https://ikaganacar.com/useless_projects/howmuchmoneyleft) to track how much money she got left.

The guide for solving this puzzle will be published when prize hits 0TL.
